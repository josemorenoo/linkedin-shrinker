# LinkedIn Shrinker

A small Chrome extension that collapses one-line-per-paragraph LinkedIn posts into normal paragraphs.

## Usage

1. Enable Developer Mode at `chrome://extensions`.
2. Choose **Load unpacked** and select this folder.
3. Open LinkedIn and start writing a post.
4. Click the extension's icon and press **Clean post**.

The extension finds the editor on the page, merges lines separated by unnecessary breaks, and restores the cursor to the end of the text.
