# LinkedIn Shrinker

A small Chrome extension that collapses one-line-per-paragraph LinkedIn posts in your feed into normal paragraphs.

## Usage

1. Enable Developer Mode at `chrome://extensions`.
2. Choose **Load unpacked** and select this folder.
3. Open LinkedIn.
4. Existing posts are cleaned automatically. Click the extension's icon and press **Clean feed** to run it again.

The extension merges adjacent single-line paragraphs in posts to reduce scrolling.
